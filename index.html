    <center><img src="Symptoms_of_coronavirus_disease_2019_3.0.png"></center>
    <center><p>The most common symptom is fever, followed by a dry cough.</p></center>
    <h2>Where did the Virus Originate?</h2>
    <p>In December last year, reports started to emerge that a coronavirus that specialists had never before seen in humans had begun to spread among the population of Wuhan, a large city in the Chinese province of Hubei.</p>
    <p>Since then, the virus has spread to other countries, both inside and outside Asia, leading the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare this as a pandemic.</p>
    <p>To date, the novel coronavirus — currently dubbed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) — has been responsible for millions of infections globally, causing hundreds of thousands of deaths. The United States is the most affected country.</p>
