    <h1>What Do You Do When You Sneeze Or Cough?</h1>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you sneeze or cough, make sure you do so into your elbow so that you don't spread germs. The Novel Corona Virus spreads through tiny respiratory droplets and sneezing and coughing openly is the ideal way the virus spreads. Therefore, please sneeze and cough into your elbow to protect those around you.</p>
    <h3>Wear A Mask When Out In Public</h3>
    <center><img src="surgical.jpg" alt="mask"></center>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the actual effectiveness is still being studied, you should try to wear a mask when you go out in public. This is only a precautionary measure for those around you. It does not protect you but it can protect those around you and catch some of the respiratory droplets that naturally come out when breathing. Some popular retailers have begun to enforce that their customers wear masks such as Costco and Whole Foods. While it can be annoying to wear the mask its all within reasonable precaution and it is considered respectable to have it on while out and about. </p>
